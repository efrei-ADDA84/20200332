### Project by Timoth√© PERIER
<br><br>
This project is a **Java spring boot application**. To obtain the weather you need to ping the application with the latitude and longitude.
Example for Efrei Paris : http://localhost:8080/weather?LAT=48.788776871408054&LONG=2.3637585999999997
<br>Note the port of the localhost may be set in the application.properties file (default : 8080).
<br> The application will return the weather in JSON format.<br><br>
# TP1 Create the project and its docker image :
<br><br>1. Build the docker image ( Docker needs to be running).
<br>The target will be automatically create using mvn package (if facing issue try specifying the Dockerfile path).
```bash 
docker build -t devops_weather -f Dockerfile .
``` 
<br>2. Run the docker image :
<br>This command also map the docker port to the computer port 8080, container name and image name can be modified.
```bash 
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e API_WEATHER_TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY --name devops devops_weather
```

<br>3. You can now ping the application with the URL above or [THIS](http://localhost:8080/weather?LAT=48.788776871408054&LONG=2.3637585999999997)

<br><br>To access the image from dockerHub you can do : 
```bash 
docker pull erebexii/devops_weather:latest
``` 
<br>Here is the docker Hub url : https://hub.docker.com/r/erebexii/repository/tags

# TP2 Create the project and its docker image :
<br> Since I made a project using spring boot, my application is already functioning as a REST API. In our case to 
get the weather you need to ping the application with the latitude and longitude and it is a GET protocol.
<br><br>Auto publish of the latest image on dockerHub.
<br>Using github actions, the image is automatically pushed to dockerHub when a push is made on the main branch.
We first create a target with all the dependencies and then we build the docker image.
<br><br>

# TP3 Push the image to the cloud (Azure):
<br>
For this TP the goal was to push our API image (tag:latest) to the cloud on the azure ressource group of the class. 
<br><br>

You can then access the API on this link : http://devops-20200332.francecentral.azurecontainer.io:8080/?lat=5.902785&lon=102.754175
<br>Note the port is specified to 8080 since it's the port of the application (defined in the properties).
<br><br>

A "home" route has been added to correspond to the requirements of the TP. Such that you can execute (on **linux**) the following command:

```bash
curl "http://devops-<identifiant-efrei>.francecentral.azurecontainer.io:8080/?
lat=5.902785&lon=102.754175"
``` 
The "old" route are still working you can try this link to see them : <a href="http://devops-20200332.francecentral.azurecontainer.io:8080/weather?LAT=5.902785&LONG=102.754175">HERE</a>
<br><br>The difficulty here was to add the new steps to our github actions in our YAML file. We also had to deal with several different secrets github to specify the azure credentials, api key and the azure container registry... 
Some debugging was needed to understand the error messages and to fix them as we dit in the last TP.
